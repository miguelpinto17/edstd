# Correlation between mass shootings and education level in the United States

This project is the result of a final academic assignment focused on data analysis using multiple sources and layered transformation stages. We implemented a layered data architecture (bronze, silver, gold) to process, clean, and analyze datasets related to relevant social themes, particularly within New York State and the United States.

## Project Structure

- `bronze/`: Raw CSV files (original data).
- `silver/`: (optional) Intermediate transformation steps.
- `gold/`: Final datasets prepared for analysis and visualization.
- `*.ipynb`: Jupyter notebooks containing the data processing and analysis pipeline.
- `PL3G5_Entrega Final.pdf`: Final project documentation (in Portuguese).
- `PowerPoint.pptx`: Project presentation slides.

## Topics Covered

- Gender statistics
- Education in the US and NY
- HIV cases in NY
- Gun violence incidents in NY
- Economic earnings and income

## Technologies Used

- Python (Jupyter Notebooks)
- pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn
- Layered data architecture (bronze/silver/gold)
- Git and GitHub for version control

## Project Goal

To build a complete data pipeline—from data ingestion to visualization—following best practices in data engineering and analysis to extract valuable insights from public data sources with potential social impact.
